Yes. I did name it NES Sex.

No, it was not intentional.

Yes, I'm keeping the name because it's funny.

## Usage
Requirements:

- Python 3
- Pillow

Install Python from your system's package manager or [their website](https://python.org)

Install Pillow with `pip`:
```bash
pip install Pillow
# Or
python3 -m pip install Pillow
```

Next, use your terminal to use the program.

```bash
# Windows
python main.py "path\to\your\rom.nes"

# Linux
python3 ./main.py "/path/to/your/rom.nes"

# Either for macOS, I don't use it so I forgot which one it was LMAO
```

**Note**: Use `clean` instead of a file path and it will clean up the generated content

**Note**: Not all games work! Please create an [issue](https://github.com/Sushii64/nessex/issues) if a game doesn't work, and I'll work on fixing that!
